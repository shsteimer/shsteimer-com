# CLAUDE.md

This project is a website built with Edge Delivery Services in Adobe Experience Manager Sites as a Cloud Service. As an agent, follow the instructions in this file to deliver code based on Adobe's standards for fast, easy-to-author, and maintainable web experiences.

## Project Overview

This project is based on the https://github.com/adobe/aem-boilerplate/ project and set up as a new project. You are expected to follow the coding style and practices established in the boilerplate, but add functionality according to the needs of the site currently developed.

The repository provides the basic structure, blocks, and configuration needed to run a complete site with `*.aem.live` as the backend.

### Key Technologies
- Edge Delivery Services for AEM Sites (documentation at https://www.aem.live/ – search with `site:www.aem.live` to restrict web search results)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), no transpiling, no build steps
- CSS3 with modern features, no Tailwind or other CSS frameworks
- HTML5 semantic markup generated by the aem.live backend, decorated by our code
- Node.js tooling

## Setup Commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start local development: `npx -y @adobe/aem-cli up --no-open --forward-browser-logs` (run in background, if possible)
  - Install the AEM CLI globally by running `npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli` then `aem up` is equivalent to the command above
- Run linting: `npm run lint`
- Fix linting issues: `npm run lint:fix`
