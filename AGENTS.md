# AGENTS.md

This project is a website built with Edge Delivery Services in Adobe Experience Manager Sites as a Cloud Service. As an agent, follow the instructions in this file to deliver code based on Adobe's standards for fast, easy-to-author, and maintainable web experiences.

## Skills

You have access to a set of skills in .claude/skills. Each skill consists of a SKILL.md file, and other files such as scripts and resources, which are referenced from there.

**YOU ARE REQUIRED TO USE THESE SKILLS TO ACCOMPLISH DEVELOPMENT TASKS. FAILING TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN WASTED TIME AND CYCLES.**

### How Skills Work

Each skill is a directory in `.claude/skills/` with the following structure:

```
.claude/skills/
  └── {skill-name}/
      ├── SKILL.md        # Main instructions (required)
      ├── scripts/        # Optional supporting scripts
      └── resources/      # Optional resources (examples, templates, etc.)
```

The SKILL.md file contains detailed instructions that you must follow exactly as written. Skills are designed to:
- Provide specialized workflows for common tasks
- Ensure consistency with project standards and best practices
- Reduce errors by codifying expert knowledge
- Chain together when tasks require multiple skill applications

### Skill Discovery and Execution Process

Always use the following process:

1. **Discovery**: When a new conversation starts, discover available skills by running `./.agents/discover-skills`. This script will show you all available skills with their names, paths, and descriptions without loading everything into context.

2. **Selection**: Use each skill based on its name and description when it feels appropriate to do so. Think carefully about all the skills available to you and choose the best ones to use. Note that some skills may reference other skills, so you may need to apply more than one skill to get things done.

3. **Execution**: When you need to use a skill:
   - Read the full SKILL.md file
   - Announce you are doing so by saying "Using Skill: {Skill Name}"
   - Follow the skill's instructions exactly as written
   - Read any referenced resources or scripts as needed
   - Complete all steps in the skill before moving to the next task

### Available Skills

Skills will be added to `.claude/skills/` as needed for this project. Common skills for AEM Edge Delivery projects include:
- Block creation and development
- Testing and validation workflows
- Performance optimization patterns
- Content authoring support tools

Check the `.claude/skills/` directory for the current list of available skills.


## Project Overview

This project is based on the https://github.com/adobe/aem-boilerplate/ project and set up as a new project. You are expected to follow the coding style and practices established in the boilerplate, but add functionality according to the needs of the site currently developed.

The repository provides the basic structure, blocks, and configuration needed to run a complete site with `*.aem.live` as the backend.

### Key Technologies
- Edge Delivery Services for AEM Sites (documentation at https://www.aem.live/ – search with `site:www.aem.live` to restrict web search results)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), no transpiling, no build steps
- CSS3 with modern features, no Tailwind or other CSS frameworks
- HTML5 semantic markup generated by the aem.live backend, decorated by our code
- Node.js tooling

## Setup Commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start local development: `npx -y @adobe/aem-cli up --no-open --forward-browser-logs` (run in background, if possible)
  - Install the AEM CLI globally by running `npm install -g @adobe/aem-cli` then `aem up` is equivalent to the command above
- Run linting: `npm run lint`
- Fix linting issues: `npm run lint:fix`

## Local Development Workflow

### Starting the Development Server

Run the local dev server in the background when possible:

```bash
npx -y @adobe/aem-cli up --no-open --forward-browser-logs
```

**Important:** Check the terminal output when starting to see what port the server is using.

- **Default port:** 3000 (http://localhost:3000)
- **Custom port:** Use `--port 3001` flag to specify a different port
- **Git worktrees:** Automatically use different ports to avoid conflicts
- **Multiple instances:** You can run multiple dev servers simultaneously for different projects/worktrees on different ports

Since multiple instances can run, track whether you started the server in your current session rather than just checking if a process is running.

### Auto-Refresh Behavior

The dev server automatically detects and refreshes changes to all code and config files. **No restart needed for code or config changes.**

### When to Restart the Server

Only restart if you need to **change CLI options**, such as:
- Adding `--html-folder drafts` to test local HTML files during Content Driven Development
- Changing the port with `--port`
- Modifying other command-line flags

### Development Best Practices

- Run the server in the background during development sessions
- Note the port from the terminal output when starting
- Keep it running while making code changes - auto-refresh handles everything
- Check the terminal output for errors or warnings from `--forward-browser-logs`

## Pull Request Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Use the format: `feature-name` (lowercase with hyphens)

**Important:** This format is required because branch names are used to generate preview/live URLs for testing.

Examples:
- `hero-block`
- `testimonial-carousel`
- `footer-redesign`

### Creating Pull Requests

When creating a pull request, include:

1. **Link to related issue(s)** (if applicable)
2. **Summary of changes** - What was added, modified, or fixed
3. **Preview/Live URL** - Link to the feature branch preview for testing
   - Format: `https://[branch-name]--[repo]--[owner].aem.live/`
   - This allows reviewers to test the changes directly and for running pr checks. **WITHOUT THIS YOUR PR WILL BE REJECTED!**

Example PR description:
```markdown
## Related Issues
Fixes #123

## Summary
Added new testimonial block with support for author image, quote text, and attribution.

## Testing
Preview: https://testimonial-block--shsteimer-com--shsteimer.aem.live/drafts/testimonial
```

## Deployment

### Environments

Edge Delivery Services provides you with three environments. Your local development server at `http://localhost:3000` serves code from your local working copy (even uncommitted code) and content that has been previewed by authors. You can access this at any time when the development server is running.

For all other environments, you need to know the GitHub owner and repository name (`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner` or `git remote -v`) and the current branch name `git branch`)

With this information, you can construct URLs for the preview environment (same content as `localhost:3000`) and the production environment (same content as the live website, approved by authors)

- **Production Preview**: `https://main--{repo}--{owner}.aem.page/`
- **Production Live**: `https://main--{repo}--{owner}.aem.live/`
- **Feature Preview**: `https://{branch}--{repo}--{owner}.aem.page/`

### Publishing Process
1. Push changes to a feature branch
2. AEM Code Sync automatically processes changes making them available on feature preview environment for that branch
3. Open a pull request to merge changes to `main`
   1. in the PR description, include a link to https://{branch}--{repo}--{owner}.aem.page/{path}` with a path to a file that illustrates the change you've made. This is the same path you have been testing with locally. WITHOUT THIS YOUR PR WILL BE REJECTED
   2. If an existing page to demonstrate your changes doesn't exist, create test content as a static html file and ask the user for help copying it to a content page you can link in the PR
4. use `gh checks` to verify the status of code synchronization, linting, and performance tests
5. A human reviewer will review the code, inspect the provided URL and merge the PR
6. AEM Code Sync updates the main branch for production

## Key Concepts

### Content

CMS authored content is a key part of every AEM Website. The content of a page is broken into sections. Sections can have default content (text, headings, links, etc.) as well as content in blocks.

Use the `content-driven-development` and `content-modeling` skill for more information on how to use content as part of the development process.

### Blocks

Blocks are the re-usable building blocks of AEM. Blocks add styling and functionality to content. Each block has an initial content structure it expects, and transforms the html in the block using DOM APIs to render a final structure.

Use the `building-blocks` skill for more information on block development guidance and best practices.

### Auto-Blocking

Auto-blocking is the process of creating blocks that aren't explicitly authored into the page based on patterns in the content. See the `buildAutoBlocks` function in `/scripts/scripts.js`.

Additional information on auto-blocking can be found in the `content-modeling` skill.

### Three-Phase Page Loading

Pages are progressively loaded in three phases to maximize performance. This process begins when `loadPage` from `/scripts/scripts.js` is called.

* Eager - load only what is required to get to LCP. This generally includes decorating the overall page content to create sections, blocks, buttons, etc. and loading only the first section of the page. It is critical to not muddy up the eager phase with anything not required for LCP.
* Lazy - load all other page content, including the header and footer.
* Delayed - load things that can be safely loaded later here and incur a performance penalty when loaded earlier such as tag managers, ad platforms, and otehr third-party dependencies.

## Security Considerations

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
- consider that everything you do is clients-side code served on the public web
- Follow Adobe security guidelines
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use the .hlxignore file to prevent filed from being served

## Contributing

- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Test changes locally before committing
- Run a PSI check on your branch and fix performance issues before raising a PR
- Ensure all linting passes
- Update documentation for significant changes
